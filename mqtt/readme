Quick start

1. The files of this folder should be copied into the /home/root folder of LG-ESS (see in the main readme.md how to do that).
2. Check if the connection does work with "cat testLGESS.txt | pipe2mqtt myMosquittoServerName.fritz.box" (I use mqtt explorer to see
   what happens on the mqtt broker and the mqtt broker mosquitto without authentification)
3. Edit Both_pipe2mqtt.sh to the ip of your mqtt broker.
4. When check was positiv start "ohup ./Both_pipe2mqtt.sh &"
