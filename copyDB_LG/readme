The LG-ESS Gen1 has its own database.
It has limitted memory and deletes old data.
To work with and save the data it is easier to copy it into a mariadb
It will install 2 tables PVLG (one column for every 15 min) and PVLGmonth (monthly data)

You should have a local mariadb with the username=user and the password=user.

There is a dashboard file LG-db.json for grafana.

You need
An empty mariaDB database Haus (and change user, password to your needs)
sudo apt install python3-mysql.connector

start with copyDB_manuell.sh
copy the file ems_DEU.db from your LG-ESS device into this folder and start the bash script



for the bash files copyDB_LG.sh and copyDB_LG_direct.sh you need also:
sudo apt install sshfs
sudo mkdir /media/lge-ems
