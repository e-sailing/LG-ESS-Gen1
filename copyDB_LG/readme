The LG-ESS Gen1 has its own database.
It has limitted memory and deletes old data.
To work with and save the data it is easier to copy it into a mariadb
You should have a local mariadb with the username=user and the password=user.

There is a dashboard for grafana. The dashboard LG-db.json can be imported.

You need
An empty mariaDB database Haus (and change user, password to your needs)
sudo apt install python3-mysql.connector
sudo apt install sshfs
sudo mkdir /media/lge-ems
